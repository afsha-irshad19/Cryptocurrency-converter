       <h1>Features</h1> 
<p>Let us understand the cryptocurrency market by first understanding its features. These shall help us understand the ebbs and flows of this emerging asset class.</p>

<span class="sub-heading">⦿ Cryptocurrencies are very secure</span>: <span class="para">They are secured by cryptography codes and locked using a public cryptographic system. Every owner has a private key. So, no one can access that private key other than the owner. The cryptography used to create this private key is so strong that the numbers are so huge that it is almost impossible to break. Therefore, one can use cryptocurrencies without fear of security.</span><br><br>

<span class="sub-heading">⦿ Transactions in cryptocurrencies are irreversible :</span> <span class="para">One of their disadvantages is the irreversibility of transactions. When you use cryptocurrency like bitcoin, you must confirm before the trade occurs. Once you give the confirmation, the transaction will be initiated. And no one in the world could stop that transaction, not even Satoshi Nakamoto himself (or themselves). So, to deal with cryptocurrency transactions, you must be much more responsible before confirming a transaction.</span><br><br>
<span class="sub-heading">⦿ There is no need for permission :</span><span class="para"> You do not need to take a permit from anybody while using it. That means there would be no gatekeepers stopping you from using the currency. All you need to do is to install free software and use it. This specific feature gives users much freedom to use cryptocurrencies as they wish.</span><br><br>
<span class="sub-heading">⦿ Super-fast:</span> <span class="para">Another great feature is that they are super-fast. If you initiate a transaction, it is immediately caught up in the network and confirmed within two minutes.</span><br><br>

<span class="sub-heading">⦿ These currencies do not care about the specific location :</span><span class="para"> Cryptocurrencies do not care about the owner’s physical location. So you can send cryptocurrency to your relative down the street or send the same to a friend from another world. And the transactions would take the same time and would be treated similarly.</span><br><br>

<span class="sub-heading">⦿ One can hide real-world identities:</span> <span class="para">Many people are scared to death when they need to share their identities online. However, in the case of cryptocurrencies, you do not need to provide your real-world identities. All you need to have is an address that has around 30 characters. And you would be able to access their benefits easily.</span><br><br>
